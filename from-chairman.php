                                <p class="text-justify">Many people start business full of hopes and dreams, only to see them Crash and Burn, and these were intelligent, hard working and passionate individuals, many of them with business degrees.</p>

                        <h2>So, why did they fail?</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify">Well, simply because intelligence, passion and hard work alone are not enough to build a successful business.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">If you look at statistics, only a small percentage of start-up businesses actually achieve success and that’s for a wide range of reasons. One way to increase your chances of success as a small business operator is to become a FRANCHISEE</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">As a ALOHA Franchisee, you will benefit from being able to follow a proven system for success and can also take full advantage of the ALOHA brand name recognized for quality education worldwide. If you are willing to make the necessary financial investment, invest a lot of hard work, time and dedication in your business, and strictly follow the ALOHA Franchise system you choose to pursue, your chances of success increase dramatically. By becoming an ALOHA FRANCHISEE partner, you will be allowed to pursue your dreams, achieve financial independence and lead an extremely happy and rewarding position in life.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Launching a start up business takes a tremendous amount of Time, Knowledge, Capital and Business acumen. The business owner must simultaneously be able to handle a wide range of responsibilities and make many important decisions. Even for an experienced business person, owning and operating a business venture can be extremely risky. The fear of failure, inadequate capital and lack of core business knowledge often keep people from achieving their professional goals, especially when launching a successful business.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">To eliminate fear, reduce the risk of failure and provide the training that entrepreneurs need to successfully launch their business, one of the best option is to operate a FRANCHISE. One of the benefits of operating a franchise is that most franchisees are provided with a proven road map with directions to operate the business, along with all the training needed to make the business successful.</p>

                        <h2>What is a Franchise?</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify">A franchise is a proven business model developed by the franchisor (the company that has created the business and is making it available to franchisees through franchising agreement), which allows the franchisee to utilize its established trademarks, proprietary business plan and methods of doing business in exchange for a recurring payment, which often involves a percentage of gross sales along with the franchisee fee. The franchisor will provide its franchisees with training, a proven business model, a well known and well established brand name, and a wide range of other tools and resources to help ensure success.</p>
