                            <p class="text-justify"><em>What you‚Äôre about to read is an extremely personal, never told before, story that Cheryl has decided to share with you, her precious people. Why? Only so that you can see that if she could do it, then so can you. </em></p>
                            <h3 style="font-weight:bold;">PART I:</h3>
                            <p class="text-justify">Cheryl Pinto was born to loving parents, who moved as immigrant workers from India to Dubai. Her parents were from a lower-middle class Indian family. Her father spent months looking for work and would often walk 10-kms to save 30-cents in taxi fare. But eventually both her parents found jobs, her mother working shifts and often seeing very little of her two little girls. Both her parents worked long and hard hours to bring money home and raise their two precious daughters.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Cheryl grew up to become an inquisitive, energetic, high spirited child. On one hot afternoon, Cheryl, now a 12-year old girl, was playing with her sister, glad that both her parents were home that day üòä That's when she overheard a (life-changing) conversation between her parents.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">She overheard her Mom say, in a rather quiet but worried tone, <em>"We have two daughters‚Ä¶.</em> We will need to save a lot of money for them." In the Indian culture, sadly even today, when girls get married, their families give a substantial sum of money to the family of the groom - perhaps as a misguided assurance that the new family will care for their daughters.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Then, she heard her Dad say with a tense tone <em class="bold">"We don't have money & I don‚Äôt know about how much we will be able to save for them‚Ä¶."</em></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">A tense silence followed. </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">But then he continued in a somewhat more determined-sounding tone "But what I do know is that I will give them one of the most valuable treasures I can afford‚Ä¶. I will give them the best education I can."</p>

                                <p class="text-justify">Being the curious girl that she was, she went up to her dad and asked <em>‚ÄúWhy education Dada?‚Äù</em> </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">The answer: <em class="bold" style="font-size: 16px;">‚ÄúAny other type of wealth that I may give you - be it money or gold, someone else can take it away from you. But education is a type of wealth that will always continue to bring you wealth and is something that nobody can ever take away from you.‚Äù</em> </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">And on that day, albeit unconsciously, Cheryl's direction and destiny were formed and sealed. </p>
                                <p class="text-justify">Her little mind was now changed with a new knowledge of what she picked up as being two very important things ‚Äì <span class="bold" style="font-size: 18px">Education & Money</span>. <em class="bold">But Education, being the most important.</em></p>

She knew that the job would being the <em class="bold">Money</em> & the universities, the <em class="bold">Education</em>. Her hunger for education was, however, insatiable.

Her bosses noticed her extraordinary zeal, enthusiasm and inclination to quickly learn what she did not know how to do.
