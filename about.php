                            <p class="text-justify">Hi there, my friend! <i class="far fa-smile"></i> Great to have you here. Glad you stopped by.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">I was born a few years ago (don’t ask when <i class="far fa-smile"></i>) in this wonderful city called <strong>Dubai</strong>. When I was born, it was a quiet, quaint, dusty little city.The city grew with me, rising <strong>from sands to skyscrapers.</strong> The city <strong>bloomed and boomed</strong> around me, turning into an oasis of wealth, 7-star hotels, healthcare, education and technology. I saw, first-hand, what a <strong>powerful vision, belief and perseverance</strong> can do. This city and its leaders taught me that <strong>truly nothing is impossible.</strong></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">My parents moved to the Dubai over 40 years ago and were of humble means. I had to work to make enough money to buy a mobile phone and so <strong>started working when I was 16 years old</strong> (yes, there weren’t strict rules around minimum age back then ). I worked to buy my first car, pay for my University tuition. I worked hard & earned every Dirham I spent. I worked for over <strong>17 years in the banking industry.</strong> Then finally in 2017, I took the <strong>leap of faith</strong> and let go of what most people called a <strong>‘stable-high-paying job’ to pursue what really mattered to me – helping people find their greatness</strong> and <strong>trading</strong> the financial markets.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">I am an active Toastmaster, have <strong>travelled to 35 countries, scuba-dived</strong> when I was a hydrophobic, <strong>sky-dived,</strong> run a <strong>half-marathon</strong> (goal is to complete the full marathon in 2018), learnt <strong>kick-boxing, horse-riding</strong> (currently working on my motor-bike license) scaled and <strong>summited Mount Kilimanjaro</strong> (5,895m/ 19,341 ft) in July 2017, among various other ‘crazy’ things. Doing what I previously considered impossible has given me the <strong>irrefutable knowledge that our limitations are self-imposed.</strong> And well, doing the impossible is lots of fun!<i class="far fa-smile"></i></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">II have always had an <strong>unquenchable thirst for education</strong> and learning – I am a <strong>certified NLP Master Practitioner</strong> and an <strong>Advanced Life Coach.</strong> I have two Masters degrees (yes, one wasn’t good enough for me! LOL), am an <strong>alumni of the Harvard Kennedy School</strong> and have tens of certifications in a varied plethora of fields (Arabic language, Design Thinking, Reiki Healing, Health &Fitness, <strong>Avian Biology</strong> to name a few).</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Today, I <strong>coach</strong> my wonderful clients, <strong>trade</strong> the financial markets, spend time with my amazing <strong>pets</strong> (I have a cat and an African grey parrot), <strong>read </strong>and <strong>travel</strong>. I would love to get to know you too and look forward to catching up with you over a cup of coffee soon<i class="far fa-smile"></i> </p>
