                            <p class="text-justify">Hi there, my friend! <i class="far fa-smile"></i> Great to have you here. Glad you stopped by.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">I was born a few years ago (don’t ask when <i class="far fa-smile"></i>) in this wonderful city called <strong>Dubai</strong>. When I was born, it was a quiet, quaint, dusty little city.The city grew with me, rising <strong>from sands to skyscrapers.</strong> The city <strong>bloomed and boomed</strong> around me, turning into an oasis of wealth, 7-star hotels, healthcare, education and technology. I saw, first-hand, what a <strong>powerful vision, belief and perseverance</strong> can do. This city and its leaders taught me that <strong>truly nothing is impossible.</strong></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">My parents moved to the Dubai over 40 years ago and were of humble means. I had to work to make enough money to buy a mobile phone and so <strong>started working when I was 16 years old</strong> (yes, there weren’t strict rules around minimum age back then ). I worked to buy my first car, pay for my University tuition. I worked hard & earned every Dirham I spent. I worked for over <strong>17 years in the banking industry.</strong> Then finally in 2017, I took the <strong>leap of faith</strong> and let go of what most people called a <strong>‘stable-high-paying job’ to pursue what really mattered to me – helping people find their greatness</strong> and <strong>trading</strong> the financial markets.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">A Coach, be it for a professional athlete or a CEO, performs the same role. A life coach is someone professionally trained to help you maximize your full potential. To be world-class in anything you do, you need the accountability, guidance, enthusiastic support and objective perspective of a coach.</p>
