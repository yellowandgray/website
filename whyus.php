                            <h3 class="text-center color-blue">How big is the global enrichment industry?</h3>
                            <p>In 2012, market research company Global Industry Analysts, Inc (GIA) announced the global private tutoring market will surpass US$102 billion by 2018. Countries in Asia, notably Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and China contribute significantly to the global private tutoring market. South Korea alone was projected to reach US$14 billion – or 15 percent of the entire market – by 2012.</p>
                            <p>Another survey done by MasterCard a year later revealed parents in Asia Pacific spent, on average, 14 percent of their monthly household income on enrichment classes. The study also revealed more than two thirds of the households in Asia Pacific are willing to spend on enrichment classes – which are extra spending on top of school fees – for their children. More than half of parents in Thailand (52 percent) are spending on extra tuition while households in Malaysia and Singapore trail just behind at 46 and 45 percent respectively. Adding to MasterCard’s Consumer Purchasing Priorities – Education survey, various stakeholders say the trend is hard to miss. While more established countries such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia had traditionally led the pack, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and India are now marked to show significant growth as well.</p>
                            <p>The MasterCard report also showed a large percentage of parents in China (53 percent), Thailand (43 percent) and Vietnam (40 percent) enrolling their children in foreign language enrichment classes.</p>
                            <p>Experts say the trend is upheld by Asian parents who feel the need to invest in education.</p>
                            <p>The strong economic growth of emerging countries such as Vietnam, India and China has contributed to a new affluent middle class. The meeting of these factors will push towards further growth in the education industry. Jumping on the bandwagon is the first enrichment mall in Malaysia. The School, located within Jaya One in Petaling Jaya, offers a mix of tenants but its draw is the 40 percent of businesses that offer creative learning in the arts, sciences, languages and arithmetic. The brains behind the concept say two in three mothers in Malaysia enrol their children in up to two enrichment classes a week. They surmised it would be wise to offer parents a place to shop and catch up on errands while their children attend extracurricular classes.</p>
                            <p>From playing catch up to leading the pack, China’s private kindergartens are embracing Western-style play learning and mixing it with project-based learning. These micro private schools often have their own curriculum separate from the official education system, which is often seen by parents as oppressive. Parents who have enrolled children in these types of private educational platforms say their children love it and even refuse to take leave when they are ill.</p>
                            <p>In an updated 2016 report, GIA said the global private tutoring market is forecasted to reach US$227 billion by 2022. This is in part driven by a need to keep pace with classroom teaching and enhance knowledge and skill level. The report said “higher education is linked to better opportunities in the job market, higher remuneration and improved social standing”, which leads to parents investing heavily in their children’s educational foundation.</p>
                            <p>While a good tertiary education is important, parents know children require a solid foundation to stand on. A senior reporter opined in the Straits Times that she would send her children to enrichment classes to save them from the possible repercussions of falling behind in school.</p>
                            <p> The global private tutoring market is a mainstay in today’s knowledge economy. Can you afford to be left behind?</p>

                            <h5>Location</h5>
                            <p>The key to any service-oriented business is visibility. Having a good location for your AALUV Math centre will help you hit the ground running. There are three key points to location and they include high traffic, good visibility and good neighbours.</p>
                            <p>Our business model has been proven to work well in places with high density (around 30,000 households in a 5-kilometre radius) of middle-income families. It is vitally important for the location to have ample parking space too.</p>
                            <p>Although AALUV Math centres function a little differently according to the particular country, there are always some constraints. The location ideally should have places where parents can tend to their own matters during or after class time such as in a mall that has supermarkets or other retail outlets, where families enjoy going to every week.</p>
                            <p>However, some centres also benefit from a relatively quiet location such as villas or standalone buildings. For locations such as these, it is advisable to be in a place with other complementary enrichment centres and should also have food and beverage outlets nearby for parents to wait for their children.</p>
                            <p>"A 'quiet' location may also be suitable for a second centre as you can direct traffic from your first centre where it is visible," </p>
                            <p>One of the key factors that help parents decide on enrolling their children is they can attend to an alternative task, such as weekly grocery shopping, while waiting for their children. We can consult with you on your unique location issues and help you find the ideal location.</p>
                            <p>Our experienced support team will help you narrow down the locations based on traffic, visibility as well as the clientele in your chosen area. We will offer our professional recommendations by reviewing and rating your possible locations. </p>
                            <h5>Be a Friendly Competitor</h5>
                            <p>One of the best pieces of advice we have for new centres is to send our flyers to retail neighbours and surrounding condominiums and houses. This will help you cast your net, create visibility for your centre and the brand and get people talking about you. There should be a new centre opening promotion such as a course fee discount for the first 50 students who register. A generous beginning will let you build presence in the community. </p>
                            <h5>Ample Space</h5>
                            <p>An AALUV Math Centre should be large enough to accommodate at least five classrooms as well as a reception area with a customer service counter. It should have a relatively comfortable customer waiting area, a library and a teacher’s room.</p>

                            <h3 class="text-center color-blue">How do I finance my franchise?</h3>
                            <p>Funding a project that you are passionate about is not as difficult as it may look. </p>
                            <p>With our experience in ALOHA franchisees, have tapped into a variety of financing resources ranging from personal savings, company loans, conventional loans and home-equity loans. Before we can offer this to our franchisees, here are some ways to fund your dream.</p>
                            <h5>Local Banks</h5>
                            <p>One of the best ways to get a loan is from your local bank. Such a loan is supported through guarantees from Small Business Administration loan options. They are less restrictive and tend to favour brands with a regional presence like ALOHA</p>
                            <p>Property secured loans tend to have the lowest interest rates of all loans and are also amongst the easiest type of loan to obtain.  Potential franchisees may look into refinancing their properties to free up some cash to finance their dream. Additional funds could be secured though a line of credit based on a portion of your property ownership equity which can help with overhead and renovation costs.</p>
                            <h5>The Bottom Line</h5>
                            <p>Your cash outlay also depends on factors such as whether you’re building a centre from scratch or refurbishing an existing property. </p>
                            <p>For more information, please fill in the franchisee request form or request a representative to walk you through the process. You will find it easier to reach your dream than you think!</p>

                            <h4>Franchise Opportunity</h4>
                            <h4>Do you have a burning desire to be your own boss?</h4>
                            <p>Well, if you have this burning desire, then we have the skills, expertise, proven business model, well defined system and real time experience to help you create a successful business venture, starting from scratch.</p>
                            <p>It doesn’t matter where you are in life right now. You may be a professional, a middle or senior manager or ageneral manager or even a fresh graduate.</p>
                            <p>The best part is that you don’t need huge sums of money or a degree from a prestigious university or experience in industry & commerce.</p>
                            <p>All you need to have is an open mind to learning, desire to succeed and the willingness to work hard, with business ethics and integrity.</p>
                            <p>Many people start business full of hopes and dreams, only to see them Crash and Burn, and these were intelligent, hard working and passionate individuals, many of them with business degrees.</p>
                            <h4>So, why did they fail?</h4>
                            <p>Well, simply because intelligence, passion and hard work alone are not enough to build a successful business.</p>
                            <p>If you look at statistics, only a small percentage of start-up businesses actually achieve success and that’s for a wide range of reasons. One way to increase your chances of success as a small business operator is to become a FRANCHISEE</p>
                            <p>As a ALOHA Franchisee, you will benefit from being able to follow a proven system for success and can also take full advantage of the ALOHA brand name recognized for quality education worldwide. If you are willing to make the necessary financial investment, invest a lot of hard work, time and dedication in your business, and strictly follow the ALOHA Franchise system you choose to pursue, your chances of success increase dramatically. By becoming an ALOHA FRANCHISEE partner, you will be allowed to pursue your dreams, achieve financial independence and lead an extremely happy and rewarding position in life.</p>
                            <p>Launching a start up business takes a tremendous amount of Time, Knowledge, Capital and Business acumen. The business owner must simultaneously be able to handle a wide range of responsibilities and make many important decisions. Even for an experienced business person, owning and operating a business venture can be extremely risky. The fear of failure, inadequate capital and lack of core business knowledge often keep people from achieving their professional goals, especially when launching a successful business.</p>
                            <p>To eliminate fear, reduce the risk of failure and provide the training that entrepreneurs need to successfully launch their business, one of the best option is to operate a FRANCHISE. One of the benefits of operating a franchise is that most franchisees are provided with a proven road map with directions to operate the business, along with all the training needed to make the business successful.</p>
