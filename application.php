                        <p>Standard disinfectants are either ineffective or highly corrosive in nature.</p>
                        <p>This is because most disinfectants are leaching chemicals. This makes them not only futile against deadly infections, but also increase antimicrobial resistance in pathogens, and drastically increases spread of infections.</p>
                        <p>Apart from this the added burden of human error factor during every application increases the operation costs exponentially.</p>

                        <p>It’s the bacteria that grows on our feet or in the shoes we wear that actually cause odour.</p>
                        <p>These bacteria convert the sweat and oil from skin into a complex mixture of chemical compounds that lead to unpleasant odours. The truth is that your shoes DO NOTHING to stop your sweat turning into odour!</p>
                        <p>Sure, many brands might argue their shoes have better ventilation & odour absorbing chemicals. But, unless that sweat “magically disappears” from your shoes, the bacteria are going to accumulate and YOUR feet is going to produce unpleasant odours!</p>
