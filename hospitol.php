                        <h3>Delivering Powerful Outcomes</h3>
                        <p>Fresche is the worlds first surface bonding, aqueous based, broad spectrum antimicrobial which delivers high level, persistent, continuing, antimicrobial control and  protection of surfaces and substrates in healthcare environments. Fresche delivers a terminal kill of bacteria, and because it is not ingested into the bacteria it does not permit the building of microbial resistance.</p>
                        <p>Fresche contains no heavy metals, no toxic chemicals, no poisons. It is green, clean and safe for patients, patient families, hospital employees, and the environment.</p>
                        <p>Unlike conventional biocides, Fresche SiQac compounds do not leach, and they do not deplete as a bound antimicrobial, and inhibitory performance does not diminish on account of the disinfection process. Because of this, Fresche stands continually on guard to protect surfaces from microbial attack and colonisation.</p>
                        <p>We believe it is a powerful advance in the management and control of healthcare acquired infections [HAI's], and offers health providers significant potential to improve patient health outcomes together with lowering of patient risks, and facilitating release of hospital assets tied to re admissions on account of increasingly aggressive patient HAI’s.</p>

                        <h3>Protecting Hospital Patients</h3>
                        <p>The challenge for hospital and healthcare practitioners is how to prevent and control hospital-acquired and other healthcare-associated infections in a perpetually changing medical environment.</p>
                        <p>Hospitals worldwide, are experiencing an increased volume of immuno compromised patients, increasingly complex medical procedures and a growing presence of harmful and biocide resistant microorganisms.</p>
                        <p>Most biocides available today in India have limited time efficacy, lasting generally from a few minutes to a few days.</p>
                        <p>Fresche is a powerful new weapon in infection management, persistently protecting surfaces from attack or colonization by pathogens, and reducing potential touch points which promote cross contamination.</p>

                        <h3>Protecting Hospital Employees</h3>
                        <p>All hospitals have infection control procedures and policies, and staff take every precaution to avoid infections. However the risk of employee infection can never be eliminated and some employees have a higher risk of acquiring an infection than others.</p>
                        <p>A key issue, is the fact that pathogens are transmitted around hospital environments either as airborne pathogens, or as passengers on textiles and equipment moving in and around the hospital environment.</p>
                        <p>Fresche is highly efficient when applied [or infused] into all forms of textiles. As a bound antimicrobial, it delivers a 99.9% terminal knock down of bacteria, followed by persistent microbial protection for the life of the textile.</p>
                        <p>Its “lock and bond” is durable for minimum 50 washes.</p>
                        <p>While Infusion of Fresche to textiles is best at the production stage, hospital textiles can be retro-treated with great results.</p>

                        <h3>Protecting Hospital Environments</h3>
                        <p>Modern day hospitals are large scale communities in themselves, embracing surgeons, administrators, casualty staff, paramedics, nursing teams, contractors, patients, families, patient doctors, visitors and hospital ancillaries. The hospital environment is both complex and intense.</p>
                        <p>Hospitals worldwide are severely compromised by the presence of pathogens which impact sick or unwell patients, whose recovery depends on being cared for in a safe, secure and hygienically clean environment.</p>
                        <p>Fresche SiQac technology stands alone in its capacity to deliver a safer more protected environment for patients and healthcare employees.</p>
                        <p>Its non-leaching, non-depleting, non-chemical mode of action is a quantum opportunity for infection control managers and hospital administrators to gain significant traction in the war on superbugs and pathogens.</p>

                        <h3>Protecting Hospital Laundry</h3>
                        <p>The best approach is for Fresche microbial protection to be applied to hospital textiles at the manufacturing stage. Fresche technical managers work with hospital suppliers to implement this powerful microbial control technology.</p>
                        <p>Traditional methods of sanitizing hospital laundry is by application of either steam                                        [or heat] to the face of the textile or by chemical sanitization. This frequently degrades the life of the textile, and is not always efficient.</p>
                        <p>Fresche can be applied to hospital linen in a protocol where Fresche microbial protection compounds are applied to the textile during the final stage laundering process. Following this application, most treated hospital textiles can be washed in cold water and still meet healthcare standards. This represents a significant saving in energy costs and carbon footprint</p>
                        <p>Fresche Bioscience can engage with hospital laundry staff to conduct application and bacterial challenge validation trials.</p>
