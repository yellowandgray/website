                            <p class="text-justify">Most of us are aware of <strong>sports persons and athletes having coaches.</strong> We have heard of health coaches & coaches in our gyms. We also agree that <strong>these coaches have played an instrumental, oft times, a pivotal role in the success of their ‘coachees’.</strong></p>
                            <p class="text-justify">However, lesser known is the fact <strong>that nearly every successful person you know has had a coach.</strong> Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs, Bill Clinton, and even Barack Obama have <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/31/business/global-office-coaching/" target="blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">all reported</a> using coaches on a regular basis to advance in their careers.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify"><strong>A Coach, be it for a professional athlete or a CEO, performs the same role.</strong> A life coach is <strong>someone professionally trained to help you maximize your full potential.</strong> To be <strong>world-class in anything you do,</strong> you need the <strong>accountability, guidance, enthusiastic support and objective perspective</strong> of a coach.</p>
