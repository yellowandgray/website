To do so,it calculates requirements through interfaced solar,load and grid energy meters and converters this requirements into set points.Then converts set-point values into control commands and send to the inverters.This happens continously and as and when the solar is generating excess power,the controller sends the control signal to curtail the power generation from solar inverters,which reduces the overall plant generation to prevent back feeding.S-LOG controls the power generation from 1% to 100% as per the load requirement.</span>
