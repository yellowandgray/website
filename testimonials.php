                            <p class="text-justify">Cheryl Pinto has been my life coach for the past 5 months. I was working in the IT industry for 5 years and felt like I needed a change and pursue a passion I always had but never had the courage to follow. By accident I met Cheryl and we started working together. She has been very successful in her own career – she has walked the walk – corporate professional, high intensity work. So therefore she understood my world. She is very capable with her skills with NLP. Her general good nature and intelligence makes Cheryl very easy to work with. She is very smart. She drove me, pushed me in areas I probably wasn’t comfortable to go but I wanted to go. It’s been absolutely phenomenal. Now I am completely changing career and going on a new journey which I am so excited about. I’ve gone from being minorly depressed to majorly excited about the future. I cant thank Cheryl enough and I can’t recommend her enough. It’s difficult to make major changes without someone there to support you, to guide you and to push you. If you’re looking to make that sort of change or impact, then Cheryl is definitely one of the best I’ve worked with –I know, I’ve tried a few :) Good luck!</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">Today is just the 18th day since we began our coaching session. With just 2 sessions, falling short of words to describe the transformation that's taking place in my life. In such short time, i have explored & realized things which i was always struggling with! Wish I had known you before .. Thanks for guiding me to clean up my mind out of fears, worries, limiting beliefs and filling me with hope, confidence, clarity, goals and above all helping me understand myself and my purpose. I always believed that nothing comes easy in life, one needs luck on his side and influence of others. After meeting you, I feel life is so simple and everything is possible and achievable. You truly are God's gift to mankind. You have not only brought change within me but also in my family. Thank you very much!</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">At the outset I looked at NLP with a lot of skepticism and it was only because I trusted Cheryl that I decided to give it a shot. She has the ability to make you believe and it comes very naturally to her. As sessions go by, she makes you comfortable enough to open facets of yourself which you wouldn't share with anyone. This enhances her understanding and empathy of you and enables her to perform the various NLP techniques with great effect. The clarity and pin-pointedness with which Cheryl helped my situation is something which has made me understand and manage myself better. I am a better-focused and more energized version of myself. There are obvious improvements in my speech, body language, mental state of being and most importantly i am a tad bit spiritually enlightened. Hand over your absolute 100% trust to her and she will go beyond what is required to help improve your life. She has the emotional and mental maturity as well as the talent and technique to use her NLP skills and understanding to help channel you in the right direction.</p>

I have worked with Cheryl over the past 14 months and I can term our engagement as a wonderful journey of discovering new things, acquiring new habits and learning how to utilize my 24 hours in the best way possible. The key thing I have learned working with Cheryl is how to replace my current habits with new better habits in a small and gradual manner. Now I am working towards setting new goals for myself and I feel more empowered to achieve them then ever before. I have realized that there is so much to achieve and best way to achieve your goals is to work with people who believe in you (like Cheryl).</p>

Follow-up, Encouraging and Motivating are some of the things she does regularly, and it makes a big difference.  The most important for me was keeping the spirit until we achieved the desired result. Now I am focused on continuously trying to achieve my desired result. Managing my time effectively is one of the key changes I have experienced since coaching with Cheryl. </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">I would definitely recommend Cheryl. I have not reached where I should be, people will follow mostly successful people. I am confident that one day I will be in a position where people will ask me about my journey and I will refer them to take Cheryl’s help to reach their desired outcomes! People should know that they will gain the confidence and openness to express themselves without any hesitation  (personal as well as professional) to achieve their target after working with Cheryl. Thank you so much for making a change in my life, Cheryl!!</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">I was really looking forward to having a life coach for myself as I felt that its a time for me to work on myself personally and professionally.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Post our session, I had clarity in my thoughts and that helped me a lot in the way I was looking at things. I started making commitments and pushed myself to keep them. A few of the small, but important changes I have already experienced are as below: </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">- I attended Toastmasters meetings as committed</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">- I kept a diary of 3 Daily “To-Do’s” / or a weekly schedule ever since and has been able to follow almost 95%.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">- I started going for yoga</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">I liked Cheryl’s approach towards me. Cheryl is a kind and non-judgmental person. At the same time, she is very particular. Her openness and non-judgmental attitude helped a lot in allowing me to express myself. She could get me back on track whenever I lost my focus while talking to her. I have become more introspective. This helps me in staying focused on the outcome that I want and constantly working on improving myself to achieve them.</p>
                            <p class="text-justify">I would definitely recommend Cheryl and her services as it is very important to have clarity in terms of what you want in your life and how you can achieve the same. I would recommend her coaching to someone who is seeking these answers or looking for this change in their life.</p>

                            <p class="text-justify">I am more confident, happier and hopeful after the sessions with Cheryl. I resigned from my previous job where I couldn’t find my purpose and felt stagnated. I realized it is ok to dream big and aspire for more even after being a tied down to a job for 10.8 years. I am taking time off to relax; find myself and not stress about being on the run all the time. I liked her positivity and friendliness. I didn’t feel judged and she respected my views and helped me understand things in a smarter way. I am inspired with the inspirational videos you share regularly with me. With the help of coaching I am able to share what I learnt from Cheryl with other friends who may have been going through a difficult time in their career or personal lives. </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">I would definitely recommend Cheryl to my friends and family members. They would be able to benefit from Cheryl’s knowledge. Cheryl is trustworthy and has a heart for helping others.</p>

Quite a few things changed such as I pushed hard to get a junior support staff to handle a key account with me so I could focus on other different projects. I’ve spoken to the top management about my appraisal. </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">It is very easy to communicate with Cheryl. Cheryl is focused and result oriented person who is not afraid to chase dreams and aspirations. And she passes on that way of thinking during interactions with her. </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">The benefits I have got is it has helped me to become an organized person. I keep a reminder of the goals set and work towards achieving them. </p>
