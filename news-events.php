                                    <p>World Food Day is celebrated every year across the world on 16th October. It is an annual celebration in the honor of the founding date of the Food and Agriculture Organization launched by the United Nation in the year 1947. To create an awareness about healthy food we organized an intraclass cooking without fire fest at ENPEE International School. Our wall magazine emphasized the importance of nutritious and healthy food habits. A variety of mouth-watering delicious dishes tempted and attracted each and everyone alike. Relishing and sharing the food, ensured that happiness reigned. Our children understood the benefits of consuming healthy fresh food. With added knowledge about World Food Day our juvenile returned home excited to brief their parent about their wonderful experience. #ENPEE #ENPEEInternation #CBSESchool #Karaikal #WorldFoodDay</p>

                                    <p>Learning is a process which continues forever. We learn from every little thing and every little children. School is one such place which gives space for an individual to mould himself. During this period the vital role is played by an Educator only. Whatever the child becomes tomorrow the seed for it is sowed by their teachers alone. Above all the celebration at school the most important is Teacher's day. It was an immense pleasure to enjoy the special day of the educators with the little ones.</p>

Symbolically, children and Educators wore religious outfits and discussed about the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (the messenger in Islam who was ready to sacrifice his son Ismail to prove his obedience to God) Usually, cow, camel and goat will be sacrificed Children wished each other in the Islamic way. We ensure that we not only do symbolic representation, but do ensure that knowledge gets transferred to children in any given occasion. #ENPEE #ENPEEInternationalSchool #Karaikal #Bhakrid #EidMubarak</p>
